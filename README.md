A recommendation system is designed to suggest post categories to users based on how they interact with content. It evaluates simple actions like likes, comments, shares, and bookmarks, plus how long users spend reading each post. The system assigns scores to these interactions, considering both the action taken and reading time to gauge interest. The post with the highest score points to the user's most preferred category, which the system then recommends. This approach tailors content suggestions to match user preferences, enhancing their experience by directing them towards content they're likely to enjoy.
